# Graph Style Customizer

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin that enhances your Graph View with customizable node highlighting, edge styling, and style rules based on folders, tags, or files.

## Features

### N-hop Neighbor Highlighting

Visualize the connection distance from your active note:

- **Active Node**: Highlight the currently focused note with a distinct color
- **Hop-based Colors**: Set different colors for 1-hop, 2-hop, 3-hop... neighbors (up to 5 hops)
- **Hop Opacity**: Control how faded the furthest neighbors appear. First hop is always 100% opaque; intermediate hops interpolate smoothly. Also applies to edges in By-hop mode.
- **Disconnected Nodes**: Fade out unconnected nodes with adjustable opacity

### Edge Styling

Customize how edges (links) appear in your graph:

- **Color Modes**:
  - `Inherit`: Edge inherits color from source node
  - `By-hop`: Edge color based on hop distance
  - `Single`: Uniform color for all edges
- **Edge Width**: Different widths for active, default, and disconnected edges
- **Arrow Sync**: Arrow colors automatically match their edge colors

### Node Sizing

- **Default Size**: Base size multiplier for all nodes
- **Active Size**: Larger size for the active node to make it stand out

### Style Rules

Create rules to style nodes based on:

- **Folder**: Apply styles to all notes in a folder (e.g., `Projects/`)
- **Tag**: Style notes with specific tags (e.g., `#important`)
- **File**: Target individual files by name

Each rule can specify:
- Custom color
- Node shape (Circle, Square, Diamond, Triangle, Hexagon)
- Size multiplier

Rules are prioritized by order - drag and drop to reorder.

### Presets

Save and switch between different style configurations:

- Create named presets with your preferred settings
- Quick-switch between presets via command palette
- Cycle through presets with a keyboard shortcut

### Scope Control

Choose where styling applies:
- Global Graph View
- Local Graph View
- Or both
